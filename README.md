# Parallel_WVT_ICs
A python code for producing SPH initial conditions using Weighted Voronoi Tesselations
The code is based on my SPH solver (repository 1DSPH) and the C code to produce ICs using WVT by jDonnert (repository: WVTICs).

Compared to the WVT_ICs code, the code provided here is supporting parallel support using the ray package.

Instructions for installation of ray can be found here here: https://docs.ray.io/en/master/installation.html
